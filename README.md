# Website
This repository is for our clients @ HealthCare North.

Here is the branching strategy we would follow for our repository and some good practices to consider:

GitHub-Flow: 

* We have one master (or main) branch, and developers will be using a feature (or release) branch to propose changes to the website.

* Once developer raises a Pull Request, it has to be approved by authorized team members to be able to merge into the main branch. 

* Once your changes are deployed to main, you are free to delete your feature branch to avoid confusion. (It is safe to do so).

* When you want to work on another feature, it is encouraged to create a new branch, make the changes you want and merge them into main after approval from authorized team members.
